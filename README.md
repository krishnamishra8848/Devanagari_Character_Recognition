# Devanagari Character Recognition Model

This repository provides a robust deep learning model for recognizing handwritten Devanagari characters and digits. The model is capable of predicting individual characters with high accuracy, making it a useful tool for OCR (Optical Character Recognition) tasks involving Devanagari script.

## Model Overview

The model is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on a dataset of grayscale images of Devanagari characters and digits. It takes in an input image (32x32) and outputs the recognized character or digit.

### Strengths:
- **High Accuracy**: The model achieves a validation accuracy of **98.1%** with a low validation loss.
- **Lightweight**: The model is efficient and runs seamlessly on both CPU and GPU environments.
- **Simple to Use**: The model is available as a pre-trained `.keras` file and can be integrated into applications with minimal setup.

### Weaknesses:
- **Limited to 46 Classes**: The model only recognizes characters and digits in the provided dataset and cannot generalize to unseen or complex handwriting styles.
- **No Contextual Understanding**: The model predicts each character individually and does not consider the context of adjacent characters.
- **Preprocessed Input**: The model expects a fixed input size of 32x32 grayscale images. Additional preprocessing is required for larger or colored images.
